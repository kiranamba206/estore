== Description ==

**Hummingbird makes your website faster and optimizes site performance by adding new ways to boost Google PageSpeed Insights with fine-tuned controls over file compression, deferring CSS and JavaScript styles and scripts, minify for CSS and JS, Lazy Load integration, and world-class caching.**

Hummingbird is brought to you by the WordPress speed specialists that created [Smush](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/) image optimization, now active on more than +1 million websites. Get the complete speed boost with Hummingbird and Smush.

### If PageSpeed Insights is making these speed recommendations Hummingbird can help:

- Enable text compression - Use gzip to make your site fly.
- Preconnect to required origins - Use Hummingbird to establish earlier connections.
- Preload key requests - Prioritize resources based on order.
- Avoid enormous network payloads - Consider Lazy Load for comments or breaking up smaller posts.
- Use efficient cache - The Hummingbird Cache suite offers effective browser cache for caching any site.
- Fix your JavaScript execution time - Deliver smaller JS payloads, preload JS, and defer JS.
- Minify CSS - Strip unused code from your CSS.
- Minify JavaScript - Speed up the time it takes to parse your JS files.
- Eliminate render-blocking resources - Move critical CSS and JS inline and defer all non-critical JS/CSS.
- Defer unused CSS - Defer the loading of CSS not used for above-the-fold content.
- Lazy Load offscreen images ([Smush free](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/) integration).

= Hummingbird Features to Speed Up WordPress =

### Scan and One-Click Fix

Hummingbird is a WordPress speed optimization plugin. It will scan your site, find files that are slowing it down, and provide tips and fixes for making your site run at top speed.

Hummingbird even has one-click improvements like a full cache suite, one-click minify for styles and scripts, and deferring CSS and JS for quickly optimizing performance. What could be easier!

### World-Class Caching

You’ll get a world-class caching suite, including full-page, browser, and Gravatar cache.

Make your site load even faster with Hummingbird’s complete set of cache tools that give your visitors a faster browsing experience. Including full-page, browser and Gravatar caching.

### Asset Optimization

Did you know that the more files you add to your site’s header, the slower it will load? With Hummingbird, you can easily customize the load position of your CSS, JavaScript (defer CSS and Javascript) and other files to increase your page speed.

Quickly reorder, compress, and reposition files with Hummingbird’s minification feature. But play carefully – minification is a powerful tool (though if you need it, you can reset any changes you make in one click).

### Transfer Data at Top Speed With GZIP

Hummingbird has GZIP powers to make sharing your site more efficient.

Sending zipped files is faster and can save you money on hosting. And don’t worry about setup, send Hummingbird instructions with the click of a button and she’ll handle the rest.

### Built-in Cloudflare Integration

Hummingbird can be used to control your [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) browser cache settings as well! Simply add your Cloudflare API key and configure away.

### Fully Compatible With Smush Image Optimization

You can complement Hummingbird’s WordPress speed optimization features with our award-winning sister-plugin [Smush image optimization](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/). Smush compresses your images, giving your site less to load – and thus a faster load time. Hummingbird + Smush integrate perfectly together, and are the perfect match to speed up WordPress.

Compress, optimize (optimise), and fix PageSpeed performance with properly sized images, lazy load, next-gen WebP convert, image formatting, and more.

= Faster Websites Rank Higher, Convert Better =

Every millisecond counts: your visitors expect an ever-faster website, with a page load time of under two seconds expected - and the norm. If visitors *don’t* get that on your site, they *will* leave.

If you’re running a business website or eCommerce store, that means **if your website does not load quickly, you will lose sales.**

Hummingbird is here to help you; it’s a one of a kind WordPress performance optimization plugin that can make your site run at superspeed, for free!

You get our WordPress performance optimization suite, which includes minification and GZIP for small page sizes, full caching for faster loading, and integration with Cloudflare’s browser cache, and our sister-plugin [Smush image optimization](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/).

Hummingbird is built with ease-of-use in mind; it makes your WordPress site faster, but it’s also fast to set up. You can scan your site and implement recommended changes in one-click, getting a fast site in mere minutes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Somebody help! I turned on Asset Optimization and it broke my site!? =

Asset Optimization is a great way to speed up your site but moving, combining, using minify, and rearranging CSS and JavaScript (.JS) files can also mess with styling and break functionality. We recommend making incremental changes and testing your site as you go so you can undo the changes if something breaks. And remember, don’t panic. If something goes wrong you can start over with the click of a button :)

== Screenshots ==

1. Scan your site for optimization tips and tricks.
2. Use the complete suite of cache tools to speed up load times.
3. Asset Optimization lets you combine and reposition CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files.
4. Use suggestions to make improvements and speed up your site.
